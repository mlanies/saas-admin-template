## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- You must be logged into the admin panel
- You need appropriate permissions to manage groups
- At least one user should exist in the system

### Accessing the Groups Section

1. Log into the admin panel
2. Navigate to the "Groups" section in the main navigation
3. You will see the groups dashboard with an overview of all groups

## Creating Groups

### Step-by-Step Guide

1. **Navigate to Groups**
   - Click on "Groups" in the main navigation
   - Click the "Create Group" button

2. **Fill in Group Details**
   - **Group Name** (required): Enter a descriptive name for the group
   - **Description** (optional): Provide additional context about the group's purpose

3. **Create the Group**
   - Click "Create Group" to save
   - You will be redirected to the group details page

### Best Practices

## Managing Group Users

3. **User Roles**
   - **Admin**: Can manage the group, add/remove users, change permissions
   - **Member**: Has access according to group permissions

### Managing Existing Users

1. **Change User Roles**
   - Use the role dropdown next to each user
   - Select the new role (Admin or Member)
   - Changes are saved automatically

2. **Remove Users**
   - Click the trash icon next to the user
   - Confirm the removal
   - User will be removed from the group

### Best Practices

- Start with a few admin users who can manage the group
- Regularly review group membership

## Setting Group Permissions

### Understanding Permissions

The system uses a matrix-based permission system with:

**Resources:**
- **Customers**: Manage customer data
- **Subscriptions**: Manage subscription plans
- **Admin Panel**: Access to admin dashboard
- **Groups**: Manage user groups

**Actions:**
- **Read**: View data
- **Write**: Create and edit data
- **Delete**: Remove data
- **Admin**: Full access

### Configuring Permissions

1. **Access Permission Settings**
   - Open the group
   - Click "Permissions" or navigate to the Permissions tab

2. **Use the Permission Matrix**
   - Check the boxes for the permissions you want to grant
   - Each row represents a resource
   - Each column represents an action

3. **Save Permissions**
   - Click "Save Permissions" to apply changes
   - All group members will inherit these permissions

### Permission Examples

**Customer Support Team:**
- Customers: Read, Write
- Subscriptions: Read
- Admin Panel: Read
- Groups: None

**Sales Team:**
- Customers: Read, Write, Delete
- Subscriptions: Read, Write
- Admin Panel: Read
- Groups: None

**System Administrators:**
- All resources: Admin (full access)

## Managing Groups

### Editing Group Information

1. **Access Group Settings**
   - Open the group
   - Click "Edit Group"

2. **Update Information**
   - Modify the group name or description
   - Click "Update Group" to save changes

### Deleting Groups

1. **Delete Confirmation**
   - Open the group
   - Click "Delete Group"
   - Confirm the deletion

2. **Important Notes**
   - All users will be removed from the group
   - All permissions will be deleted
   - This action cannot be undone

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
